NOTE :
[1] go to assets/sqlunp.txt
[2] write your sqlun,sqlp, in the file instead of mine as i have written there
[3] check if mysqli commands run in your system , if not please run them , as they are new and old ones will soon be depricated
[4] dont change mysql commands to old one , its takes much work to change them back
